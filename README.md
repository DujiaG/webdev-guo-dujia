Dujia Guo - Web Development Fall 2017

My name is Dujia Guo and I am working towards a masters of computer science degree at Northeastern. I received my undergraduate degree from Colby College as a history major and mathematics minor. I have worked on a few small projects, such as storing information of nutritional research papers in a mySQL database and creating a symbol recognizing tool in java. 
This repository stores all my work in CS5610 web development, such as assignments and projects. The rest are the links pointing to them:
